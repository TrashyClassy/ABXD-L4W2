# AcmlmBoard XD

The new and secure AcmlmBoard-like board.
This repository has been created to document changes made in my forum,
and to more easily manage the repository and code changes implemented
on the site. If you need a demo go to http://l4w2-gamers.ml/ .

## Warning

Please note that you are using a version of ABXD obtained from the Git
repository. This version of ABXD may have serious vulnerabilites and
might not work at all.

If you are interested more stable software, you may want to download
[ABXD 3.0](http://github.com/ABXD/ABXD). It's known to
work almost everywhere.

## Installation

[Download ABXD](https://github.com/Dirbaio/ABXD/zipball/master), put it
on the HTTP server (PHP has to be installed), visit the location of
ABXD in your server and follow the installer. It couldn't be easier.

## Bugs

Checkout [L4W2 Site Discussion](http://l4w2-gamers.ml/?page=forum&id=8)
forum. Feel free to report all bugs. Security bugs should be handled
in PMs. Regular testing is done to make sure everything is secure.

## Contributions
